# MCP Server Configuration

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) configuration is stored in [.cursor/mcp.json](mdc:.cursor/mcp.json). This file defines the available MCP servers and their configurations.

## Server Configurations

### Sequential Thinking Server
The sequential thinking server provides advanced problem-solving capabilities through structured thought processes. It is configured to run via NPX:

```json
{
  "command": "npx",
  "args": [
    "-y",
    "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"
  ]
}
```

### FileSystem Server
The FileSystem server handles file operations within the workspace with the following configuration:
- Root directory: `./`
- Allows access to all files (`**/*`)
- Excludes `node_modules` and `.git` directories
- Watches for file changes
- Case-insensitive file operations
